LT. & continuous manual backwashing was done (As Auto mechanism is out of service) -At around 0833 Hrs. LT. Main Engine Auto shutdown was activated. -Immediate cause was M/E HCO Main filter DPH on Aconis panel, which was followed by Low inlet pressure to HPS pumps on MOP Panel followed by Auto shut down. -Note: # M.E LO Auto backwash filter & HCO Main filter drain lines are interconnected & lead through the sludge checker to the MELO Sump. #HCO Main Filter Auto backwashing is initiated by hydraulic motor which gets oil supply from inlet to the filter & outlet is lead to the drain line which goes through the sludge checker to the MELO Sump. # M/E LO Auto back wash filter auto mechanism is out of service & manual back flushing carried out at 1-hour interval. 14th May 2022, at 1830 Hrs. All parameters were under observation, At around 1830 Hrs. LT all parameters were normal, except the auto backwashing movement of the HCO Main filter which has again slowed down & was about to stop. Sludge checker filter back pressure checked & found to be around 1.5 Bar. (This parameter was not noticed at 1st instance) This indicated chocking of the sludge checker filter, which slowed the oil movement through the hydraulic motor which drives the HCO Main filter auto backwashing arrangement. In order to avoid another slowdown, decided to check the condition of Sludge checker filter, the inlet valve to the sludge checker filter was shut & all parameters were under observation so as to check if it will initiate any alarm. Again M/E HCO Main filter DPH on Aconis panel activated, which was followed by Low inlet pressure to HPS pumps on MOP Panel followed by Auto shut down at around 1844 Hrs. LT. As engine was shut down, immediately sludge checker filter was removed & inspected. Found slight sludge formation, it was cleaned with 6 bar air & fitted back in place. Engine was started again. Found sludge checker filter back pressure 0.2 bar & HCO main filter auto backwash movement was back to normal. 16th May 2022, at 0445 Hrs. After 34 Hours, found Sludge checker filter back pressure has increased to 1.5 Bar again & HCO Main filter backwashing movement has completely stopped.",

This was a low water berthing, Low water was at 14:30 hrs Vessel was to berth Port Side Alongside (final tie up 4+3 FWD and AFT) The Captain, Chief Officer and the pilot were on the bridge. Engine, Thruster and helm controls were on the port bridge wing console The tug \"Switzer Kathleen\" was attached by tugs line to the main deck (aft of manifold - forward of accommodation ladder). ON 10-FEB-2023 at 1454, the vessel had sent first lines ashore, via heaving lines (2 foreword and 2 aft springs) The vessel was parallel to the berth and moving alongside, the SOG was less than 1 knot. At the time of mooring, due to tide level, the vessel's main deck was level with the top of the jetty. The bow of the vessel (FRAME 143-144) made a hard landing to the jetty structure. There was no damage to the jetty. The vessel completed the mooring operation and was all fast on 10-FEB-203 at 15:48. The area was inspected after all fast, and the damage reported. The vessel reported q17 and complied with the instructions sent.",

Inlet and outlet valves for condensers on Air condition no 1 is closed (As this was the first alarm).Thought that the air/gas there was coming into the cooling water system was coming from A/C Condenser (But it was Cooling water was displaced from AC Unit so no cooling => High pressure on AC Unit and not as first thought).

Cargo discharge suspended, terminal informed, manifold closed.Troubleshooting has been carried out; Was a hole in the tube in the cooler on starting air compressor no 3 between stage 1 and 2. The leak meant that compressed air, was pressed into the cooling water system and displaced 2.6 m3 of water in the cooling water in the system. (Out of the expansion tank and down to the bilge wells) No cooling water Circulated in the system meant that the Aux Engine was stopped because of high cooling water temperature as they should. (So no failure on AE/Generator) Cooling water was filled into the expansion tank and at the same time was the cooling water system vented on Aux Engines, High Temp / Low Temp Cooling water pumps and other placed where the air had gathered.
